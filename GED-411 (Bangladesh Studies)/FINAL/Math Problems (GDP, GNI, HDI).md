## 🔢 PART A: GDP NUMERICALS

### 📌 Formula (Expenditure Method)

[
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M)
]

Where:

* **C** = Consumption
* **I** = Investment
* **G** = Government expenditure
* **X** = Exports
* **M** = Imports

---

### 🧮 Problem 1: GDP Calculation

**Given:**

| Component               | Amount (in crore BDT) |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Consumption (C)         | 500                   |
| Investment (I)          | 200                   |
| Government Spending (G) | 150                   |
| Exports (X)             | 100                   |
| Imports (M)             | 80                    |

**Find:** GDP

#### ✅ Solution (Step-by-Step)

[
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
]

[
GDP = 500 + 200 + 150 + (100 - 80)
]

[
GDP = 500 + 200 + 150 + 20
]

[
GDP = \boxed{870 \text{ crore BDT}}
]

---

### ✍️ Exam Writing Tip

👉 Always **write the formula first**, then substitute values.

---

## 🔢 PART B: GNP / GNI NUMERICALS

### 📌 Formula

[
\text{GNP / GNI} = GDP + \text{Net Income from Abroad (NIFA)}
]

Where:
[
\text{NIFA} = \text{Income from abroad} - \text{Income paid to foreigners}
]

---

### 🧮 Problem 2: GNI Calculation (Bangladesh Context)

**Given:**

* GDP = 3,000 billion USD
* Income from abroad (remittance, etc.) = 120 billion USD
* Income paid to foreigners = 40 billion USD

**Find:** GNI

#### ✅ Solution

[
NIFA = 120 - 40 = 80
]

[
GNI = GDP + NIFA
]

[
GNI = 3000 + 80
]

[
GNI = \boxed{3080 \text{ billion USD}}
]

---

### ✍️ Exam Tip

👉 Mention **remittance** when explaining GNI for Bangladesh.

---

## 🔢 PART C: PER CAPITA INCOME

### 📌 Formula

[
\text{Per Capita Income} = \frac{\text{National Income}}{\text{Total Population}}
]

---

### 🧮 Problem 3: Per Capita Income

**Given:**

* GNI = 3080 billion USD
* Population = 170 million

**Find:** Per Capita Income

#### ✅ Solution

[
\text{Per Capita Income} = \frac{3080}{170}
]

[
= \boxed{18.12 \text{ thousand USD (approx.)}}
]

---

## 🔢 PART D: HDI NUMERICAL (CONCEPTUAL)

⚠️ **Important:**
In exams, HDI questions are usually **semi-numerical + explanation**, not full calculation.

---

### 📌 HDI Components

HDI is based on **3 indices**:

1. **Life Expectancy Index (Health)**
2. **Education Index**
3. **Income Index**

[
HDI = \frac{1}{3} (LEI + EI + II)
]

---

### 🧮 Problem 4: HDI Calculation (Simplified)

**Given:**

| Index                       | Value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| Life Expectancy Index (LEI) | 0.65  |
| Education Index (EI)        | 0.55  |
| Income Index (II)           | 0.60  |

**Find:** HDI

#### ✅ Solution

[
HDI = \frac{0.65 + 0.55 + 0.60}{3}
]

[
HDI = \frac{1.80}{3}
]

[
HDI = \boxed{0.60}
]

---

### ✍️ Exam Tip

👉 Always **explain what HDI measures**, even if you calculate it.

---

## 🔢 PART E: PRACTICE QUESTIONS (FOR YOU)

### 📝 Practice 1 (GDP)

C = 600, I = 250, G = 180, X = 120, M = 90
👉 Find GDP

<details>
<summary>✔ Answer</summary>

[
GDP = 600 + 250 + 180 + (120 - 90) = \boxed{1060}
]

</details>

---

### 📝 Practice 2 (GNI)

GDP = 2500
Income from abroad = 150
Income paid to foreigners = 70

👉 Find GNI

<details>
<summary>✔ Answer</summary>

[
NIFA = 150 - 70 = 80
]

[
GNI = 2500 + 80 = \boxed{2580}
]

</details>

---

### 📝 Practice 3 (HDI – Concept)

Why is HDI considered better than GDP?

**Answer (Exam-Ready):**
HDI is better than GDP because it measures not only income but also health and education, reflecting overall human development rather than economic output alone.
