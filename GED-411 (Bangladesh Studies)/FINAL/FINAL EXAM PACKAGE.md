## 1️⃣ Define constitution and discuss the salient features of the Constitution of Bangladesh.

### Answer:

A constitution is the supreme law of a country that defines the structure of government, distribution of powers, and the relationship between the state and its citizens. It establishes the fundamental principles upon which a state is governed and ensures rule of law.

The Constitution of Bangladesh was adopted on 4 November 1972 and came into effect on 16 December 1972. One of its most important features is **popular sovereignty**, as Article 7 declares that all powers belong to the people. Bangladesh follows a **unitary state system**, where power is centralized.

The constitution establishes a **parliamentary form of government**, where the Prime Minister is the real executive authority. It guarantees **fundamental rights** under Part III, ensuring equality, freedom of speech, and protection of life. The constitution also ensures **rule of law**, **judicial review**, and **independence of judiciary**.

Overall, the constitution reflects the ideals of the Liberation War and ensures democratic governance.

---

## 2️⃣ Analyze the importance of the Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh.

### Answer:

The Preamble is considered the soul of the Constitution of Bangladesh. It reflects the philosophy, objectives, and guiding principles of the constitution. It declares that Bangladesh is a sovereign people’s republic where all power belongs to the people.

The Preamble commits the state to nationalism, socialism, democracy, and secularism. It also emphasizes freedom, justice, equality, and human dignity. Though the Preamble is not directly enforceable by courts, it plays a vital role in interpreting constitutional provisions.

The Supreme Court has frequently used the Preamble to understand the spirit of the constitution. Therefore, the Preamble serves as a moral and ideological guide for governance and law-making in Bangladesh.

---

## 3️⃣ Discuss the three organs of government of Bangladesh.

### Answer:

The government of Bangladesh consists of three organs: the **Legislature**, **Executive**, and **Judiciary**. This division is based on the principle of separation of powers.

The **Legislature**, known as the Jatiya Sangsad, is responsible for making laws. According to Article 65, all legislative powers are vested in Parliament.

The **Executive** implements laws and manages state administration. Although the President is the constitutional head, real executive power lies with the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.

The **Judiciary** interprets laws and ensures justice. It protects fundamental rights through judicial review. Together, these three organs ensure checks and balances and democratic governance.

---

## 4️⃣ Examine the constitutional amendment procedure and major amendments.

### Answer:

Article 142 of the Constitution outlines the amendment procedure. Any amendment bill must be passed by a two-thirds majority of Parliament and receive presidential assent.

Major amendments include:

* **4th Amendment (1975)**: Introduced one-party system and weakened democracy.
* **12th Amendment (1991)**: Restored parliamentary democracy.
* **13th Amendment (1996)**: Introduced caretaker government system.
* **15th Amendment (2011)**: Restored secularism and abolished caretaker government.

These amendments show how constitutional changes have shaped Bangladesh’s political history.
