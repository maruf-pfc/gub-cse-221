### 1. Definition and Background

**Global warming** refers to the long-term increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature, primarily caused by the excessive emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that leads to rising global temperatures. Global warming is one of the most serious environmental challenges of the modern world and is closely linked with **climate change**, which includes long-term changes in temperature, rainfall patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events.

The issue of global warming gained global attention in the late twentieth century due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, and large-scale use of fossil fuels. Scientific evidence now confirms that human activities are the main drivers of global warming, making it a critical concern for both developed and developing countries.

---

### 2. Theoretical Explanation of Global Warming

From an environmental science perspective, global warming is explained through the **greenhouse effect theory**. According to this theory, greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface and re-radiate it back, causing the atmosphere to warm. While this process is natural and essential for life, human activities have intensified it to dangerous levels.

Environmental theories emphasize that unchecked global warming disrupts ecological balance, threatens biodiversity, and undermines sustainable development. Climate justice theory further highlights that countries with lower emissions often suffer the most severe consequences, creating global inequality.

---

### 3. Causes of Global Warming

The major causes of global warming include:

**Burning of Fossil Fuels:**
The use of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, transport, and industry releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

**Deforestation:**
Large-scale deforestation reduces the Earth’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, increasing greenhouse gas concentration.

**Industrial Activities:**
Factories release greenhouse gases and pollutants that contribute to atmospheric warming.

**Agricultural Practices:**
Methane emissions from livestock and rice cultivation significantly contribute to global warming.

**Urbanization and Population Growth:**
Rapid urban expansion increases energy consumption, waste generation, and emissions.

---

### 4. Consequences of Global Warming

Global warming has far-reaching consequences for the environment and human society. Rising temperatures lead to **melting of glaciers and polar ice caps**, causing sea-level rise. Extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, droughts, and heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense.

Global warming also threatens **food security**, public health, water availability, and ecosystems. Increased temperatures disrupt agricultural productivity and spread climate-sensitive diseases.

---

### 5. Bangladesh Context: Impacts of Climate Change

Bangladesh is one of the most **climate-vulnerable countries** in the world due to its low-lying deltaic geography, high population density, and dependence on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture.

**Sea-Level Rise and Salinity Intrusion:**
Rising sea levels increase salinity in coastal areas, damaging crops, drinking water sources, and livelihoods.

**Floods and River Erosion:**
Frequent flooding and riverbank erosion displace millions of people and destroy homes, farmland, and infrastructure.

**Cyclones and Storm Surges:**
Bangladesh regularly experiences severe cyclones that cause loss of life, property damage, and economic disruption.

**Agricultural and Economic Impact:**
Climate change reduces agricultural productivity, threatens food security, and increases poverty and unemployment.

**Climate-Induced Migration:**
Loss of livelihoods forces people to migrate from rural and coastal areas to urban centers, creating social and economic pressure.

---

### 6. Examples from Bangladesh

Cyclones such as **Sidr, Aila, and Amphan** have caused massive destruction in coastal regions. Salinity intrusion in Khulna and Satkhira has reduced rice production. River erosion along the Jamuna and Padma rivers displaces thousands of families every year. These examples clearly demonstrate the real-life impacts of climate change in Bangladesh.

---

### 7. Solutions and Policy Measures

To address global warming and climate change, Bangladesh must adopt both **mitigation and adaptation strategies**.

**Mitigation Measures:**

* Promoting renewable energy such as solar and wind power
* Reducing dependence on fossil fuels
* Afforestation and reforestation programs

**Adaptation Measures:**

* Climate-resilient agriculture and salt-tolerant crops
* Construction of embankments and cyclone shelters
* Improved disaster preparedness and early warning systems

**Policy Initiatives:**

* Implementation of national climate action plans
* Strengthening environmental laws
* International cooperation and climate finance support

---

### 8. Analysis and Criticism

Although Bangladesh has taken several initiatives to combat climate change, challenges remain in implementation, funding, and coordination. Limited resources, institutional weaknesses, and lack of global accountability hinder effective action. Developed countries, despite being major contributors to global warming, often fail to provide adequate support to vulnerable countries like Bangladesh.

---

### 9. Conclusion

In conclusion, global warming is a major global environmental challenge with severe consequences for climate stability and human survival. Bangladesh, despite contributing minimally to global emissions, faces disproportionate impacts of climate change. Addressing these challenges requires integrated policies, international cooperation, sustainable development practices, and strong political commitment. Only through coordinated global and national efforts can the adverse effects of global warming be effectively managed.
